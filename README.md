# Pipelined-Processor-and-Cache

This code replicates a basic pipelined processor that forms the foundation of all processing chips in our computers. Machine code instructions are translated into assembly, then assembled into actions that are passed through a pipeline. Memory for each action is stored using a basic cache that uses most recently accessed replacement method.
